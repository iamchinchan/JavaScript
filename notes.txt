//////////////////////////////************JAVASCRIPT*************///////////////////////////////////////

fundamentals:

alert("")
we can do calulations in console
we have strings in JAVASCRIPT

programming styls: imperative, declarative: diff ways of structuring our code.

core  tech of web: HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT

JS: real pg lang of web, to add dyanmic and inetractive effects on webn page or web apps., 
it allows to manupilate content and css, load data from remote servers, to make entire apps in the browsers which we call web apps.

JS modern libraries and frameworks: Angular, React, Vue : all 100% based on JS
js can be used outside of browsers like on a server which in the end is a computing machine
so using  node.js(which is made on top of v8 js engine(to convert js code to machine code for machines to execute)) on the machine we can write js code for our back-end applications as well to handle api's and to comnnect with databse.
and back-end application run on servers: which as i said is also connected to database: so js can be used on servers to make back -end apps we can say

js: use for native mobile app(react native , ionic) or native desktop(elctron) application for any os out there

convention: camel case for variable names, uppercase all letters for constants: but it wont be considered as constant just by uppercase, 
can start with $ or _ , but not with numbers, but can also contain numbers.
dont use keywords, and should not use name is legal but we should not,
we should not uise uppercase first letter for variable names, as we use the same for classes declarations, not illegal but to maintain a convention.

number, stirng, boolean, undefined, symbol, big int, null

in js values hjas types not variables,
same variable can store diff type of values in 1 code instance

dynamic typing: change data type of value holding inside a variable



//////////////////////////////always remeber this:///////////////////////

console.log("type of string is: ", typeof string);
console.log("type of undefined is: ", typeof undefined);
let declare;
console.log("type of declare is: ", typeof declare);
console.log("value of declare is: ", declare);
let val = null;
console.log("value of val is: ", val);
console.log("type of val is: ", typeof val);
console.log("type of null is: ", typeof null);

***********************************
assignments.js:6 type of undefined is:  undefined
assignments.js:8 type of declare is:  undefined
assignments.js:9 value of declare is:  undefined
assignments.js:11 value of val is:  null
assignments.js:12 type of val is:  object
assignments.js:13 type of null is:  object
content.js:3 I am content script

//////////////////////////////////////

let: block scoped, and
var: function scoped
more in sec 7 of course;

we can ignore all 3: let, const, var, and do like this:
name = "jatin"
console.log(name);
but it will create a property on global object
this variable wont be create d in so called scoped

all the variables can be visible in browser console  while we are running it in the browser
operators:
mathematical: +,-,*,/,%, **
+ can be used to concatenate 2 strings

assigment operators: =,++,--, +=, -=,....

comparison operators: booelan result in the end: >, < ,  <=, >=
equality operators: ==, ===
logical operators: 


template literals for bis string using backticks ``

\n for new line, and if to write ion a same way in editror then use \n\ or `` (template literal)

type conversion and type coercion:
NaN: not a number
typeof NaN is:  number, so somehow it is a number but not a valid 1
functions: Number, String
type conversion only works to 3 types: boolean, number, string

prompt("");

diff operator:  !==, !=

if in prompt nothing is enetered then ot taked 0 as input not undefined or null if Number(prompt()) is used.
and it will take emplty string normally and type will be string : is used as this: prompt(); and clicked ok
and it will contain null as valuer and type of object if empty but clicked cancel using normal prompt();
so make sure to check every possibility before implementing whole code

5 falsy values: undefined, null, 0, NaN, ''
{}: this is not a falsy value, even though object itself is empty

switch case does struct comaprison : ===
default can also run if break is missing till the actual case which is matching

ternary operators: expression? true code : falsy code

and conditonal operators can be used as an expressions as they just produces values, and we can also use ternary op with them in am expression, but we have to make sure to not use statements as an ?/: part of ternary operator

for ex: we can do like this:
const age = 10;
console.log(`I like to drink ${age >= 18 ? "Wine 🍷🍾" : "milk 🥛"}`);

transpiling, polyfilling: processes to convert js of diff releases, like from Es6 modern js code to Es5
using babel for plyfilling: still to learn how our modern js code will  run in production in user's desktop using old versions of browsers which does not have implementation according to the latest release of js , which we have used in our code already
EsNext: future planned releases for js
Es6 compatibility table
